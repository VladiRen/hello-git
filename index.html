	<h1>Hello Git</h1>
	<p>
		Version Control Systems help you navigate between changes and quickly let you go back to aprevious version when something isn’t right.
		With Version Control, multiple people can work on their copy of the project (called branches) 
		and only merge those changes to the main project when they (or the other team members) are satisfied with the work.
	</p>
	<p>
		What can Git do?
		<ul>
			<li>Go back and forth between versions</li>
			<li>Review the differences between those versions</li>
			<li>Check the change history of a file</li>
			<li>Tag a specific version for quick referencing</li>
			<li>Exchange “changesets” between repositories</li>
			<li>Review the changes made by others</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		You commite every time you've finished a feature
	</p>
	<p>
		Github repository example
		Commite - push

			<li>
				Git add + commit

			<li>Git clone</li>

			<li>Git reset

				<p>
				One of the main features of Git is its Branching system. A branch is a copy of a project which you can work on 
				without messing with the repository. Branching also comes along with Merging, which is the act of copying the changesets 
				done in a branch back to the source. Generally, you create a branch to create or test a new feature and
				merge that branch back when you are satisfied with the work.
			   </p>
				<p>
					There is also a simple concept that you might use a lot: Stashing. Stashing is the act of safely putting away your current edits 
					so that you have clean environment to work on something completely different.
					 You might want to use stashing when you are playing around or testing a feature but need to work on a new feature in priority. 
					 So, you stash your changes away and begin to write that feature. After you are done, you can get your changes back
					  and apply them to your current working environment.

		Github as a sort of hosting platform, but it's not the best one

		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS (Full-stack hosting)</a>
				It's rather hard to use it because of complex building. Many things are free

			<li>
				<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify (Front-end only)</a> 
				<ol>
               <li>You have to login with your github account.</li>
					<li>Press button: Create a new site from git</li>
					<li>Continues deployment. It will update your site online as soon as you puch commitment to Github</li>
					<li>Check your index.html file. It doesn't work without it</li>
					<li>Anyway sometimes your deploys will be failed. You can see it at the list of  production deploys- retry and see deploy log before. There you can see the error and the error in your code. If you don't understand, google the error</li>
					<li>If you have problems with deploynemt, you can contact Support. They answer quicly in working time in San-Fransisco</li>
